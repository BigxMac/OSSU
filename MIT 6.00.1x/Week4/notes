Testing & Debugging
--------------------
Partition up test inputs for input space

- black box testing - based on paths through specs
- glass box testing - based on paths through code

Black Box Testing - designed without knowledge of implementation
- removes bias of implementer

Glass Box Testing - use code to design test cases
- path complete if every path through code is tested once

Testing Loop
------------
unit testing - checks algorithm
integration testing - integration bugs
- repeat -

Test drivers - test code for us
sets environment
runs code on inputs
reports results
stubs simulate parts used by unit testing not yet written

regression testing - test that works after changes

overt - code crashes, runs forever
cover - no obvious error

persistent - occurs every time code is run
intermittent - only occurs sometimes

Categories of bugs
obvious and detect
- *defensive programming* - try to make sure if bug is found it falls here
overt and intermittent
- harder, but if conditions can be reproduced it can be fixed
covert
- hard, returns a value, but a wrong value

Pre-Condition - make sure data is correct before code runs
Post-Condition - make sure code worked and didn't get a incorrect result
