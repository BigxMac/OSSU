hashing = taking in input and computing it to get the index of where to put it in a data type

hash table
uses hash function to determine where to insert in array

linear probing - move to next available space

trie
nodes of tree are arrays

tree like data structure optimized for retrieval

stack
push add to top
pop remove from top

Last in first out

queue
First in first out
enqueue add
dequeue remove

tree

binary search tree

parent is less than left child, but greater than right

doubly linked list

go forward and backwards
two pointers

chaining
hash table generally contains linked list if more than one element hashes to the same location

hash table - array of linked lists

tries use a ton of memory, but are fast

tail of queue = (head + size) % capacity
tail = back
head = front
