0.  BMP - Multiple (1, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32 bit), GIF - 8 bit (256) , JPEG - 24 Bit (16.7 Million), PNG - 24 bit (16.7 Million) & alpha channel (transparency)
1.  Only GIF supports animation
2.  Lossy compression loses data quality when it is compressed, but lossless does not.
3.  JPEG uses lossy compression
4.  The file is not really deleted, but rather just marked as unaccessible until it is overwritten.
5.  You can override the files previous location with \0
6.  IT is a header file that allows integer types of different byte sizes to be used.
7.  You can guarantee the size of what you are storing regardless of architecture.
8.  BTYE = 1 Byte, DWORD = 4, LONG = 4, WORD = 2
9.  It must be "BM"
10. bfSize is the size in bytes of the whole bitmap file, but bi size is just the number of bytes required by the structure
11. It means that the bitmap is a top down DIB with it's origin being in the top right corner
12. biBitCount
13. That file on the disk may be in use by another application or it may not have permission to read it
14. We only want to read over the file once.
15. The padding would be 1
16. It offsets the position of the file pointer which is useful when reading files
17. It is the current position of the file pointer
18. After turning the red pixels (0x0000ff) white (0xffffff) I saw a student holding a snake/stuft animal looking object.
