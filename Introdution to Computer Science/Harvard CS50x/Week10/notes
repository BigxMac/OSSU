 No understanding
"Pattern Matching"
Take text, parse, give back to user

Ex "I want to impress my boss"
Looks for "I want" -> "Why do you want"
append rest
"Why do you want to impress my boss"
one at a time
take each token
"Why do you want to impress your boss?"

Most speech recognitions contain 3 separate statistic models
Phonetic
---------
Hidden Markov Model
3 states in graph with transitions with a probability
intake, vibratory, exhale
build models of every sound and determine which one is most
likely, statistically

Word pronunciation
----------
Hidden Markov Model
Pieces phonetic information together into a word in stages

language
-------
Biagram model (endgram models)
Some words are more likely to follow another
Captures statistically all the instances when one word follows another
Like a bunch of books, text, etc
Where P is probability
Ex P(the rat ate cheese) = P(the) * P(rat) * P(ate|rat) * P(cheese|ate)

Large enough sample of data it works, and works well

In order to understand what is being said we rely on another model

Syntactic Progressing
Semantic Processing
Pragmatic Processing

non-verbal communication
As we build more complex interfaces, communication will become more and more prevalent
