Tree
------
- consists of one or more nodes
- connected by branches
- starts with a root node
- except for leaves, each node has 1+ children
    - parent node is the upper node of a "child" node
- In simple trees, no child has more than one parent (called a graph)
- binary tree, either has 0, 1, or 2 child nodes

binary tree
-----------
- useful for searching and storing ordered data

depth first search
-------------------
- start at root
- if haven't found objective take left branch
- if at leaf backtrack to where we took left branch and take right one

breadth first search
--------------------
- start at root node
- proceed to each child at next level in order
- continue until reach objective
