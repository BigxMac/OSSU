Interactive Algorithms
-Loop doing a step over and over until returning

Recursive algorithms
-call self again with a reduced argument
  base case - statement returning so it doesn't keep recurring

Stacks frames when called recursively (why values aren't same)
stacks then unwind when base case returns

Mathematical Induction
- prove true for smallest value - n
- prove true for n+1
- true for all values

0+1+2+3...n = (n(n+1))/2

Divide and conquer
- solve a hard problem by breaking it into a set of sub-problems
  - that are easier
  - thats solutions combine to solve original
