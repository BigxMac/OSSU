Code used in problems
1. def loadWords2():
2.     try:
3.         inFile = open(PATH_TO_FILE, 'r', 0)
4.     #line of code to be added here#
5.         print "The wordlist doesn't exist; using some fruits for now"
6.         return ['apple', 'orange', 'pear', 'lime', 'lemon', 'grape', 'pineapple']
7.     line = inFile.readline()
8.     wordlist = string.split(line)
9.     print "  ", len(wordlist), "words loaded."
10.    return wordlist

Problem 1A
What line of code should we add at Line 4 to solve this problem? Mark all that apply:

except:           ✔
except IOError: ✔
except ValueError as e:
except FileNotFound:
except IOError as e:     ✔

Problem 1B
Secondly, we have decided that we want to split our words up by commas instead of spaces.

What line should we change to solve this problem?

8 ✔

Problem 1C
From Problem 1B, what should the new line be?

wordList = string.split(line, ',') ✔


Problem 2 was to answer some basic questions about some code that generates a graph
to make sure your environment is set up correctly ✔
