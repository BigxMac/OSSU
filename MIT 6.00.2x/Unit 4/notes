Linear spring: amount of force needed to compress to linear in the distance the spring is compressed 
Each spring has a constant k - determines how much force is needed 

Hooke's Law 
F = -kd 
Force stored in spring is linerally related to distance 

Not all springs behave linearly 
Have a limit to the law 

How much to compress spring 1cm? 
F = 0.01m * 35,000 N/m
F = 350N 

F = ma 
Force = mass * acceleration 
Force = mass * 9.8 m/s^2
350N = mass * 9.8m/s^2
mass = 350k/9.81 
35.68kg 

How to find the spring constant?

When we fit a curve to data we find a fit that relates an independent variable to the estimated value of a dependent 

Want to find a line that some function of the sum of differences from the line is minimized 

Can measure X, Y or shortest distance (perpendicular)

Use Y because we are trying to understand Y (dependent)

Least squares objective function: 

n-1 
 Î£ (observed[i] - predicted[i])^2
i=0
   (        Residual          )

Makes optimization problem easier to solve when squared instead of using abs val for reasons that will be discussed later 
Get rid of negative because we want to know how much it differs, not in what direction
