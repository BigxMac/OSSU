Nondeterminism

-Casual
  Not every event is caused by previous events
-Predictive
  Lack of knowledge about the world makes it impossible to make accurate predictions about future event states

Stochastic Processes
- An ongoing process where the next state might depend on both the previous states and some random element

At beginning we learned that for a binary number there are 2^n possible outcomes where n is the number of digits
10^n for decimal
16^n for hex etc etc

If we are to roll a die with 6 outcomes 5 times the number of possible outcomes is 6^5

1 - (364/365)^100

Sample space - the set of all possible outcomes

event - subset of the sample space

probability function - assigns an event A a probability P(A) that represents the likelihood of an event occurring

Hash collisions
Many to one

Hash Buckets fix this

tradeoff

Large -> few collisions
faster/uses more space
Small -> more collisions
slower/uses less space
