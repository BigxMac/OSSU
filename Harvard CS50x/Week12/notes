Seminar - Statistical Programming with R

Designed for statistics and data analysis
Imperative, Weakly Typed, Interpreted

Recommended Books: (both free)
"An Introduction to R" by the devs who make R
"Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View" by C. R. Shalizi

Use for:
- Mining large data sets,
- Automated statistical analysis
- Data visualization or graphing

3 basic types: numeric type, character (string) type, and boolean type
- Vectors, matrices, and higher dimension arrays
Lists
Numeric values are vectors of size 1
No mix type arrays

assignment <-
comments #
modular %%
division %/%
ranges num:num ex 2:5 = [2,3,4,5]
ranges are 1 indexed (its not made for programmers)
for loop - for (value in vector) {}
function - foo <- function(args) {}

make an array c(data1, data2)
functions applied to each item in the array individually (like map)

matrix(data, rows, columns)
access rows foo[row,] and columns foo[,col]

list(key=val)
access and set with foo$key

dataframes used for representing tables
give columns and rows names

can assign default args to functions
no return, last statement is returned

can import and export data

multilinear regression
lm(dependentVar ~ independentVars)

simple correlation use cor function

plot using plot function

plot(x, y, ...optional args)
