When variables are passed to functions they are swapped by value
aka copied

Use pointers to pass the actual values to edit them

Like mutating functions in Swift

int* p = malloc(sizeof(int));
*p = 4;
* pointer op
* = follows pointer to value
& dereference op
& = returns address of value

* = value
& = memory address
