0.  BMP - Multiple (1, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32 bit), GIF - 8 bit (256) , JPEG - 24 Bit
1.  GIF
2.  Lossy compression loses data quality when it is compressed, but lossless does not.
3.  JPEG uses lossy compression.
4.  The filename is motified to indicate that the file has been deleted and then the file's clusters are moved to the linked list of free space clusters.
5.  You can overrite all the data on the hard drive with NULL characters (\0).
6.  It is a header file that allows integer types of various fixed memory sizes to be used independent of the underlying device implementation.
7.  You can guarantee the size of what is being stored regardless of the underlying implementation.
8.  BTYE = 1 Byte, DWORD = 4, LONG = 4, WORD = 2
9.  The values 0x42 0x4D or BM in ASCII denote the start of a bitmap file.
10. biSize is the number of bytes in the BITMAPINFOHEADER struct, and bfSize is the size in bytes of the total bitmap file.
11. It means that the bitmap is a top down DIB with it's origin being in the top right corner opposted to the top left.
12. biBitCount
13. That file on the disk may be in use by another application or it may not have permission to read it
14. 1 is the third argument because we only want to read one item at a time.
15. The padding would be 1.
16. the fseek funtion sets the file position indicator based on the arguments passed to it.
17. SEEK_CUR is a flag passed to the fseek function telling it to offset relative to the current (CUR) position indicator.
18. After removing the red from the purely red pixels, inverting the black pixels, and darkening some of the light blue pixels it appears to be a smiling young man in a suit jacket and collared shirt.
