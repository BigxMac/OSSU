Personal Finance is a tradeoff between consumption and savings/investments

It's also about understanding how much risk one can tolerate

Risk limit determines portfolio composition

Risk and return go hand and hand

There is no "home run" investment.
The market goes up, down, flat, all the time.
"Mad Money" type shows aren't to be taken for sure

Capital Asset Pricing Model - the risk is directly proportional to the expected return

Growth stock - young companies, aggressively growing, risky

Value - mature, less risk, less return

Market Cap = # of shares * share price

Large - 5b - less risk

Mid - 1b - 5b

Small cap - < 1b

micro cap - < 750m - more risk

blue chip - industry leaders

Buying Stocks
--------------
- what is the investment period
long term? few days?

long term look at company fundamentals
balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement
best time to buy when others sell due to market movements or panic

quick term  look at trading characteristics
volume, price movement, 52wk highs and lows

More likely to go up if near 52wk low - generally not all the time

Timing
--------
Ex if crude oil is down other companies will go down

Disposition effect - sell winners too soon, hold losers too long
Proved by Shefrin and Statman in 1985

To avoid - have a well defined set of rules when to sell and follow through

Primary Listing
------------------
In US NYSE/Amex or NASDAQ
trade  between 9:30am - 4:00pm

some listed on both
1-3 letters NYSE - harder to list on
4-5 NASDAQ easier to list on - tech companies

Stocks trading in NYSE have more volume, better prices, less costs

Price Discovery and Market Fragmentation
-------------------------------------------
Exchanges want to attract volume and have the share price be informative
In 1997 ECNs and ATSs started
More fragmentation, only going to get worse

Mutual Funds
-------------
For people who don't have as much time to invest
Diversified, many stocks, lower risk

Vanguard Dividend Growth
--------------------------
Morningstar good site for finding information about mutual funds
past not necessarily indicative of the future
look at a fund's manager
