Insurance

Minimize risk

- avoid (money under pillow)
- prevent/control (avoid small cap stocks)
- assume risk (its on you)
- transfer (buy put options; pay someone to take over risk)

speculate - trying to make money (offense)
insurance - defense

big losses, small likelihood - ideal for insurers

expected losses - likelihood * dollar loss
keep manageable

underwriting is deciding how much to charge for insurance
in the investment world underwriters bring companies to IPOs

moral hazard - hidden action
not able to watch you 24/7
adverse selection - information gap
don't know all

if you misrepresent yourself insurance companies can refuse to pay

Costs are kept manageable by diversification:
- calculating the frequency of occurrence and amount loss using past experience
- changing rates in risk
- finding right level to charge is difficult
- Sometimes people get "priced out" if super risky (abnormally sick)
- High risk, higher price to offset
