Pirates and Admirals
----------------------

3 Admirals
3 Pirates

2 ppl per boat going across river

Pirates should never outnumber Admiral
1 person has to row boat

I worked the problem out in a series of steps and then if I lead to a dead-end, stopped and started with another solution from the last known correct one
The correct answer is worked out below
X denotes what side of the river the boat is on, the rest is self explanatory.

     X
0P | 3P
0A | 3A

<- 1A, 1P

 X
1P | 2P
1A | 2A

-> 1A

     X
1P | 2P
0A | 3A

<- 2P

X
3P | 0P
0A | 3A

-> 1P

     X
2P | 1P
0A | 3A

<- 2A

 X
2P | 1P
2A | 1A

-> 1P, 1A

     X
1P | 2P
1A | 2A

<- 2A

X
2P | 2P
3A | 0A

-> 1P

     X
0P | 3P
3A | 0A

<- 2P

X
2P | 1P
3A | 0A

-> 1P

     X
1P | 2P
3A | 0A

<- 2P

X
3P | 0P
3A | 0A

Towers of Hanoi

I recall solving this problem programmatically when learning about recursion.

I started solving with only 3 disks, and later 4 to simplify.

6oz
10oz
Want 8oz

Fountain of Knowledge - Extra Problem
------------------------
How to get 8oz of liquid with only a 10oz and 6 oz cup with no measurements.


Fill the 10 oz cup. Pour into the 6 oz cup.
There is now 4 in the 10oz cup.
Empty the 6oz cup.
Pour the 4oz into the 6 oz cup.
Fill the 10oz cup into the 6oz cup.
This will remove 2 and you will be left with 8oz.
