A simpler shaky story: Stacy and Sam Smyth had a party where two couples were present (the Smyths and one other couple). No one shook hands with themselves and no one shook hands with his or her own spouse. At midnight, Sam Smyth asked the three other people how many hands each of them had shaken. Each person gave a different answer. That is, someone didnâ€™t shake any hands, someone else shook one hand, and someone else shook two hands. Given this outcome, how many hands did Stacy Smyth shake?
